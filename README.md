# kMeans

Matlab implementation of kmeans and [kmeans++](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/K-means%2B%2B) algorithm.

The dataset includes 2429 human faces. Each of the 2429 lines in the data corresponds to a 19 X 19 image of a human face.
Every image is represented as a 361-dimensional vector of grayscale values, in column-major format.

The mean faces are visualized in the pictures in the repository.
